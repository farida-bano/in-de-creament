Decrement, in programming, refers to reducing the value of a variable by a certain amount. Pre-decrement and post-decrement are two ways of decrementing a variable in a programming language like TypeScript.
Pre-decrement: In pre-decrement, the value of the variable is decremented before it is used in an expression.
Post-decrement: In post-decrement, the value of the variable is decremented after it is used in an expression.

Increment, in programming, refers to increasing the value of a variable by a certain amount. Pre-increment and post-increment are two ways of incrementing a variable in a programming language like TypeScript.
Pre-increment: In pre-increment, the value of the variable is incremented before it is used in an expression.
Post-increment: In post-increment, the value of the variable is incremented after it is used in an expression.
